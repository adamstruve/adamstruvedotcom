## Eleven Group — 2019-Present

- Created tools to pull stats from APIs in order to track ROI of media buys across ad networks.
- Developed tools to automate, target, and optimize web push notifications to over 8 million subscribers, resulting
  nearly 600 million clicks.

## ZeusClicks / Adboss — 2016 - 2018

- Built a system to collect stats from 40+ advertising and affiliate marketing platforms, organizing the data and importing it into Google Sheets daily via API.
- Built in house tools to help manage and organize the large domain name inventory using Angular. Motley Media — 2008 - 2018
